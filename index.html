	<h1>Bayesian Methods in Nuclear Physics</h1>
	<p>A workshop at
	  the <a href="http://www.int.washington.edu">Institute for
	    Nuclear Theory</a> at the University of Washington in
	  Seattle from June 13 to July 8, 2016</p>
	<p><b>Goal:</b> This program will bring statisticians and
	  nuclear practitioners together to explore how Bayesian
	  inference can enable progress on the frontiers of nuclear
	  physics and open up new directions for the field.

	  <h2>Questions and Discussion Topics</h2>

	  <p>
	    The following is a (partial) list of questions to be considered
	    during our program. We
	    strongly encourage participants to add their own questions
	    (and answers) as well.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    (Participants are also welcome to join the github
	    <a href="https://github.com/bayesint">project</a>.
	    Apparently it is difficult to find people with the
	    github search feature so you will need to send
	    us your github username.)
	  </p>
	  
	  <p><b>From mornings in Week 1:</b></p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Inconsistent data (or model)</li>
	    <li>Outliers</li>
	    <li>Model and uncertainty extrapolation</li>
	    <li>Empirical Bayes</li>
	    <li>Autocorrelations in MCMC</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>A. Steiner:</b> I'm using the method outlined
		<a href="http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/goodman/teaching/MonteCarlo2005/notes/MCMC.pdf">here</a>
		similar to the <a href="http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/goodman/software/acor/">acor</a> program used in
		<a href="http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/">emcee</a>.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <li>Emulation</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p><b>General questions:</b></p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>What do Bayesian techniques offer that frequentist
	      statistics do not?</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Also, what kinds of problems ill-suited for
		Bayesian or frequentist approaches?</li>
	    </ul>
	    <li>What is the modern view of the conflict (if any)
	      between Bayesian and frequentist statistics?</li>
	    <li>What are the best references (e.g., texts or
	      pedagogical reviews) for introductory Bayesian
	      statistics and for advanced topics?</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>As we compile lists: What are we missing? Are there
		more modern versions?</li>
	    </ul>
	    <li>What are the common or subtle pitfalls that novices to
	      Bayesian methods fall into?</li>
	    <li>What are we likely unaware of on the frontier of
	      (Bayesian) statistical methods?</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>D. Furnstahl:</b> In
		interacting with applied mathematicians I've found that
		physicists are often using the Numerical Recipes version
		of numerical methods, while the state-of-the-art is one
		or two generations more advanced. What are the analogs
		for statistics?</li>
	      <li><b>A Steiner:</b> I'm currently using Goodman and Weare
		(2010)'s affine-invariant MCMC. Is there any way
		to do better? I'd like to get more accurate results
		with fewer samples. Will Metropolis-Hastings methods
		be superior if I have a sufficiently accurate
		proposal distribution?</li>
	    </ul>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p><b>Parameter estimation, model calibration, and
	      model selection</b></p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>What is the difference between model calibration and
	      parameter estimation?</li>
	    <li>How should one do basic regression analysis?</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>The old-school theoretical physics way is to do a
		least-squares fit with adding penalty terms for
		theoretical errors (which could be from the model or
		from the numerical method used to calculate the model)
		in quadrature to the data errors.</li>
	      <li>When the theoretical systematic uncertainty is not
		known, one often determines the overall scale by
		requiring \( \chi^2/\mathrm{dof} = 1 \)
		(Birge factor). How is this done in
		Bayesian statistics?</li>
	      <li>When should a nuclear model with systematic theory
		errors have a statistical distribution of residuals?</li>
	      <li>What are appropriate Bayesian priors?</li>
	      <li><b>A. Steiner:</b> How does one deal with the
		ambiguity created by heteroscedasticity? E.g.
		if we have two types of data points in a
		\( \chi^2 \) fit, how do we decide the
		relative theoretical uncertainty between
		the two types?</li>
	    </ul>
	    <li>What approximations or techniques are useful for
	      reducing computational cost?</li>
	    <li>What is Approximate Bayesian Computation?</li>
	    <li>What method should I use for calculating the evidence
	      or odds ratios?</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>e.g., simulated annealing, nested sampling, analytic
		approximations, ...</li>
	      <li>What are the pros and cons?</li>
	    </ul>
	    <li>How do we propagate theoretical uncertainties (e.g.,
	      from truncations of an expansion or limitations of a physics
	      model) to calculations of physics observables?</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p><b>Priors:</b></p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>What is Bayesian model checking and how can it be used
	      to minimize or validate the influence of priors?</li>
	    <li>What are other ways to validate priors?</li>
	    <li>How does empirical Bayes work and when is it useful
	      (or dangerous)?</li>
	    <li>How do we choose priors for systematic errors in
	      physics?</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>E.g., what general guidance is there?</li>
	      <li>What range of priors should I consider?</li>
	      <li>How does one choose a "non-informative" prior?</li>
	    </ul>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p><b>Software:</b></p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>What should we know about MCMC sampling algorithms and
	      software?</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>MCMC programs are often a black box to physicists.</li>
	      <li>What are recommended implementations for different
		types of physics applications?</li>
	      <li>Are there parallelized versions?</li>
	      <li>What are the pitfalls or "tricks" in using MCMC?</li>
	      <li>Should one use more than one algorithm?</li>
	    </ul>
	    <li>What are good programs for visualization (e.g., of
	      projected posteriors)?</li>
	    <li>What are the best software options for Python, C++, R, ...</li>  
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p><b>Other:</b></p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <b>A Steiner:</b> In nuclear astrophysics, in order to
	      perform a proper uncertainty quantification, we need two
	      things: (i) the correlations between masses in the
	      Atomic Mass Evaluation, and (ii) the correlations
	      between parameters in popular mass models (e.g. FRDM).
	      How do we get those?
	    </li>
	    <li><b>A. Steiner:</b> What can be understood from the
	      analogy between a particle propagator and a conditional
	      probability distribution? Or does the fact that the
	      former is defined over complex numers spoil the analogy?
	    </ul>
