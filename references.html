	<h1>Bayesian Methods in Nuclear Physics</h1>
	 <p>A <a href="http://www.int.washington.edu/PROGRAMS/16-2a/">workshop on
          Bayesian Methods in Nuclar Physics</a> was held at
	  the <a href="http://www.int.washington.edu">Institute for
	    Nuclear Theory</a> at the University of Washington in
	  Seattle from June 13 to July 8, 2016.  These pages continue the discussion
	   initiated at this program. The workshop was the number 4 of the ISNET
	   (Information and Statistics in Nuclear Experiments and Theory) family of
	   meetings. Talks given at ISNET-3 and ISNET-5 are also listed here. </p>
	<p><b>Goal:</b> For statisticians and
	  nuclear practitioners to jointly explore how Bayesian
	  inference can enable progress on the frontiers of nuclear
	  physics and open up new directions for the field.

          <a href="https://harario.shinyapps.io/Sample_Size_Shiny/">"Sample Size Calculations

         	of parameters used in the GP "correlation family" (which define the covariance).
         	The "Sample Path Plots" tab has an app that lets you draw samples of functions
         	that depend on
         	user selected parameters (actually "hyperparameters") that specify the details of
         	the correlation family.
