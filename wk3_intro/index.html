      <h2 class="title">Goals of the Program</h2>
      <p>
	&nbsp;<br>This program will bring statisticians and nuclear
	practitioners together to explore how Bayesian inference can
	enable progress on the frontiers of nuclear physics and open
	up new directions for the field.
      </p>
      <p>
	&nbsp;<br>Goals:
      <ul>
	<li>facilitate cross communication, fertilization, and
	  collaboration on Bayesian applications among the nuclear
	  sub-fields;</li>
	<li>provide the opportunity for nuclear physicists who are
	  unfamiliar with Bayesian methods to start applying them to new
	  problems;</li> 
	<li>learn from the experts about innovative and advanced uses
	  of Bayesian statistics, and best practices in applying
	  them;</li> 
	<li>learn about advanced computational tools and methods;</li>
	<li>critically examine the application of Bayesian methods to
	  particular physics problems in the various subfields.</li>
      </ul>
      We're aiming to build a knowledge base, so we are working to
      enhance continuity across the program. Your suggestions are very
      much welcomed.<br>&nbsp;

      <h2 class="title">Speaker Instructions</h2>
      For physicists:
      <ul>
	<li>Provide a high-level (=pedagogical) introduction to both
	  the basic science questions you are trying to answer and an
	  introduction to the statistical methods you are using
	  (Bayesian or not). Please avoid jargon and remember that
	  *most* attendees will not be experts in your field!</li>
	<li>To help get your Bayesian statistical colleagues better
	  engaged, be sure to describe features of the data, models, and
	  possibly other information that is being used. Also explain
	  the goals of your investigation: Are you focused on estimating
	  key parameters? Making predictions? Choosing between competing
	  models? Seeking understanding? Also, special features of your
	  investigation will be important to present (e.g.
	  computationally demanding models, data quality).</li>

      <h2 class="title">Speaker Instructions</h2>
      For statisticians:
      <ul>
	<li>At the beginning of each week, a statistician will give an
	  overview talk of Bayesian methods, with the aim of introducing
	  common language and highlighting current research trends. The
	  speakers should avoid unnecessary jargon and remember that
	  most attendees may not be experts in applied mathematics or
	  statistics. For the rest of the week, there will be a couple
	  of talks each day on physics applications that could
	  potentially make use of Bayesian statistics. The attending
	  statisticians will be expected to engage in these talks,
	  participate in discussions with physicist at the workshop,
	  working out potential paths forward for some of these
	  applications, and possibly developing future collaborations.
	There may be utility in informally presenting some of your
	statistical work during afternoon discussions.</li>

      <ul>
	<li>Seminar etiquette: interrupt freely! May need to defer some
	questions / discussion to afternoon to allow speaker to
	  finish</li>
	<li>If notation or terminology is unfamiliar, please ask!</li>
	<li>Lunches and dinners are self-organized</li>
