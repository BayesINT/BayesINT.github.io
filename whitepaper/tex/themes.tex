\section{Themes}  \label{sec:themes}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Implication of Bayesian philosophy/practices/concepts}  \label{subsec:implications}
%
%[\emph{This may go in section~\ref{subsec:conceptual_issues} instead.}]
%
%\bi
%  \I emphasis of posterior vs.\ minimizing of $\chi^2$
%  \I sampling vs.\ optimization  
%\ei

\subsection{Likelihood function and Bayes theorem}  \label{subsec:L}

\bi
  \I Recall Bayes theorem introduced (probably) in sec. \ref{subsec:basic_Bayes}
  \I Define the likelihood function in both simple (1D) and advanced (ND) case
  \I Posing the problem (and the notations): data = model + random error
  $$ y(x) = \eta(x) + \epsilon  $$
  \I Everything else follows: GP + MCMC to actually determine $x$, variations on 
     the same theme for model defects ($\epsilon \rightarrow \epsilon + \delta(x)$ 
     and augmented $\chi^2$, choice of prior for $x$, etc.
\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gaussian Process (GP) as a tool}  \label{subsec:GP_tool}

\bi
  \I GP simulates correlations between parameters
  \I emulators
  \I discrepant functions / random effects 
  \I linear regression $\rightarrow$ GP
  \I limitations: bad at emulating waveforms (Lackey)
\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Discrepant functions / random effects}  \label{subsec:discrepant}

\bi
  \I Model discrepancy: mock up what we know about the intrinsic limitations of 
     our model into the posterior
  \I data = model + truly random error + systematic bias
  $$ y(x) = \eta(x) + \epsilon + \delta(x) $$
  \I Example of nuclear masses: deviations near closed shells (particle-vibration 
     coupling, pairing phase transition), at $N=Z$ (Wigner energy), in transitional 
     nuclei (shape coexistence) are known but sometimes very hard (=computationally) 
     to model
  \I Using model discrepancies allow ``professional'' fitting of a model at some 
     approximation while resulting parametrization is valid at higher resolution/order.
     Ex.: fit at SR-EDF level, but parameters hopefully valid at MR-EDF
  \I Avoid overfitting

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\chi^2$}{chi-squared} and dofs}  \label{subsec:}

   \bi 
       \I $\chi^2/$dof is not meaningful for Bayesian statistics
       \I dofs when there are priors
       \I how should one count dofs?
       \I augmented $\chi^2$: distance from the prior (Bartek's talk?)
       \I When does $\chi^2/$dof make sense?
       \I AWS: Bayes' factors and Occam's razor
   \ei

    parameter transformations

\subsection{Use of MCMC}  \label{subsec:using_mcmc}

  \bi
    \I must be able to evaluate quickly enough
    \I fast model vs. good emulator vs. slow function (dictates what you do)
    \I burn-in as usual; is checking autocorrelation and skipping critical?
    \I nested sampling?
    \I AWS: MCMC pitfalls: Skipping points when the likelihood
    function is zero (bad idea)
