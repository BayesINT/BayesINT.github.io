\subsection{Implication of Bayesian philosophy/practices/concepts}  \label{subsec:implications}

[\emph{This may go in section~\ref{subsec:conceptual_issues} instead.}]

\bi
  \I emphasis of posterior vs.\ minimizing of $\chi^2$
  \I sampling vs.\ optimization  
\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Discrepant functions / random effects}  \label{subsec:discrepant}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gaussian Process (GP) as a tool}  \label{subsec:GP_tool}

\bi
  \I emulators
  \I discrepant functions / random effects 
  \I linear regression $\rightarrow$ GP
\ei


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$\chi^2$ and dofs}  \label{subsec:}

   \bi 
       \I $\chi^2/$dof is not meaningful for Bayesian statistics
       \I dofs when there are priors
       \I how should one count dofs?
       \I augmented $\chi^2$
       \I When does $\chi^2/$dof make sense?
   \ei    

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pitfalls}  \label{subsec:pitfalls}

  \bi
    \I using same data to estimate priors and determine uncertainty
  \ei


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Model selection / comparison (or metrics)}  \label{subsec:model_comparison}

  \bi
    \I laundry list of approaches (see Vera's talk)
    \I new approach for nuclear physics: mixture models
  \ei


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Selection of priors}  \label{subsec:selecting_priors}

  \bi
    \I uniform vs. where it makes a difference
    \I knowledge of underlying model 
    \I running against the boundary  
  \ei


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Use of MCMC}  \label{subsec:using_mcmc}

  \bi
    \I must be able to evaluate quickly enough
    \I fast model vs. good emulator vs. slow function (dictates what you do)
    \I burn-in as usual; is checking autocorrelation and skipping critical?
    \I nested sampling?
  \ei
