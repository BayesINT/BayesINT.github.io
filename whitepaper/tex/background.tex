\subsection{Conceptual or philosophical issues} \label{subsec:conceptual_issues}

\bi
  \I In comparison to frequentist approaches, the emphasis is on sampling of posteriors
    rather than optimization (e.g., finding the maximum of the likelihood).

  \I Younger generation statistians do not have the baggage of the frequentist-Bayesian wars;
    they freely use both approaches as tools to do statistical analysis. 

  \I Is exchangability a purely formal aspect or an important consideration for practical
    purposes?
