\section{Guide to the literature (written and software)}  \label{sec:literature}

\bi
  \I The vastness of the literature on statistical methods poses a problem for the
      nuclear physicist: there is not an adequate sampling algorithm.  This is compounded
      by unfamiliar notation and terminology used by the statistics community, as well
      as conceptual differences in the formulation of problems.
  \I Here we propose a sampling of books and articles.

\subsection{General Bayesian statistics} \label{subsec:gen_bayesian_lit}

The following are often recommended as introductory guides for
physicists, because the examples and language are drawn from physics:
\bi
  \I \textit{Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial} by Devinderjit Sivia and John Skilling~\cite{Sivia:2006}.
  \I \textit{Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences} by Phil Gregory~\cite{Gregory:2005}.
  \I \textit{Bayes in the sky: Bayesian inference and model selection in cosmology}
   by Roberto Trotta~\cite{Trotta:2008qt}.
\ei

Recommended more advanced texts include:
\bi
  \I \textit{Bayesian Data Analysis} by Gelman et al.~\cite{Gelman03}.

\subsection{Gaussian Process (GP) models} \label{subsec:GP_lit}

Software:
\bi
 \I
     The \href{https://harario.shinyapps.io/Sample_Size_Shiny/}{``Sample Size Calculations for Computer Experiments''} app provides a sandbox for playing with
     Gaussian processes.  Read the ``About'' tab first; it includes definitions
     of parameters used in the GP ``correlation family'' (which define the covariance).
     The ``Sample Path Plots'' tab has an app that lets you draw samples of functions
     that depend on user selected parameters (actually ``hyperparameters'') that specify 
     the details of the correlation family.  
 \I Dan Foreman-Mackey's \href{http://dan.iel.fm/george/current/user/model/}{Gaussian Process Python 
     Library and Tutorial} steps you through using GPs with \href{http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/}{emcee}.
