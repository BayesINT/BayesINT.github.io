\section{Progress Since the Previous Long-Range Plan; Current Status}
\label{Sec:Progress}
Enormous progress has been made in the experimental and theoretical study of hot QCD matter since the 
2007 Long Range Plan\cite{LRP:2007}. A new energy frontier at the LHC, in concert with a wide variety
of experimental tools honed at RHIC, enabled rapid yet refined
analyses of the highest energy heavy ion collisions studied to date.
At the same time, upgrades to both RHIC and its experiments allowed
not only exploration of a new low-energy regime but also greatly improved
experimental sensitivity at RHIC's top energy. In combination with increasingly sophisticated
theoretical models, these developments have led to new insights into the behavior
of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. This section details
the advances in both the experimental facilities
and the results derived from them since the last Long Range Plan.
