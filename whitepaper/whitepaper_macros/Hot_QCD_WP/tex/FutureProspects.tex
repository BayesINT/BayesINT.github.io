\section{Future Prospects}
\label{Sec:Future}
The cornucopia of experimental advances and theoretical insights detailed in Section~\ref{Sec:Progress}
are but a representative sample of the advances made in the field since the last Long Range Plan.
As in all healthy scientific enterprises, our increased understanding of hot QCD matter
has engendered new questions. 
These questions are both quantitative
(``What is the precise value of $\eta/s$ at the various temperatures accessible at RHIC and the LHC?")
and qualitative
(``How does the perfect liquid behavior of quark-gluon plasma emerge from the QCD Lagrangian?")
in nature. 
In addition, opportunities exist to ask and address discovery-oriented
questions, such as ``Does the QCD phase diagram have a critical point?''
The field is poised to answer definitely such questions in the next decade,
thanks to ongoing and anticipated investments in the experimental programs 
at RHIC and the LHC, and in theoretical investigations world-wide. 
This section describes those opportunities and delineates the
progress that will follow from exploiting them.
