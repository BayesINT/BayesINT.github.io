	<h1>Bayesian Methods in Nuclear Physics</h1>
	 <p>A <a href="http://www.int.washington.edu/PROGRAMS/16-2a/">workshop on
          Bayesian Methods in Nuclar Physics</a> was held at
	  the <a href="http://www.int.washington.edu">Institute for
	    Nuclear Theory</a> at the University of Washington in
	  Seattle from June 13 to July 8, 2016.  These pages continue the discussion
	   initiated at this program. The workshop was the number 4 of the ISNET
	   (Information and Statistics in Nuclear Experiments and Theory) family of
	   meetings. Talks given at ISNET-3 and ISNET-5 are also listed here. </p>
	<p><b>Goal:</b> For statisticians and
	  nuclear practitioners to jointly explore how Bayesian
	  inference can enable progress on the frontiers of nuclear
	  physics and open up new directions for the field.

	  <h2>Statistical Notation and Nomenclature</h2>

    <p>
    The terminology and notation that is standard in Statistics are not always
    familiar to physicists.  Here we give an overview based on usage in the
    program.
